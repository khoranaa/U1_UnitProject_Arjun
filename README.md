Famous Pointillism w/ Music

<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This project is a pointillistic version of famous artworks, while playing songs from the same era of art. When you press the number keys 1-7, you can experience many paintings in the form of pointillism with music from the time period of the art playing. This is supposed to create an enjoyable experience for whoever uses it. I used arrays for each of the pictures and for the music as well. This is my first time using Minim as well.<p>
<h2> Inspiration </h2>
I was stuck for ideas for the first two days, but I knew that I wanted to do something related to art. So, what I did was that I looked up 
the different forms of art, such as pointillism, abstract, and graphic art. Then, I refined my options to one form of art based on what I 
thought looked really cool, and what was within my ability to code without copying and pasting. Then, I looked up an example of 
pointillism from Daniel Shiffman on the Processing website, and I thought that this was going to be really easy. So, I wanted to push 
myself to do more with my code and make it more complex. So, I got a suggestion from a peer to randomize different famous paintings in pointillism while playing entertaining music as well. I thought that was a really fun thing to do, since I really like art and music.
