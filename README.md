Pontillism of Famous Art While Playing Songs

<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This project is a pointillistic version of famous artworks, while playing songs from the same era of art. The paintings will
be randomized every time the code is opened.<p>
<h2> Inspiration </h2>
I was stuck for ideas for the first two days, but I knew that I wanted to do something related to art. So, what I did was that I looked up 
the different forms of art, such as pointillism, abstract, and graphic art. Then, I refined my options to one form of art based on what I 
thought looked really cool, and what was within my ability to code without copying and pasting. Then, I looked up an example of 
pointillism from Daniel Shiffman on the Processing website, and I thought that this was going to be really easy. So, I wanted to push 
myself to do more with my code and make it more complex. So, I got a suggestion to randomize different famous paintings in pointillism 
while playing entertaining music as well. I thought that was a really fun thing to do, since I really like art and music.
